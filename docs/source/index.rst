dewloosh.core
=============

The main purpose of `dewloosh.core` is to provide batteries to other dewloosh
projects.

Features
--------

* | Various dictionary classes that enhance the core behaviour of the built-in
  | `dict` type. The top of the cake is the `Library` class, which offers a different
  | behaviour for nested dictionaries by applying a self replicating defalt factory.

* | A set of tools for metaprogramming. The use cases include declaring custom abstract 
  | class properties, using metaclasses to avoid unwanted code conflicts, assuring the 
  | implementation of abstract methods at design time, etc.

* Decorators, wrappers and other handy developer tools.
